# KogniJS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aleneum/kognijs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aleneum/kognijs)

KogniJS is a framework to control a distributed smart (home) environment via [RSB](http://docs.cor-lab.org/rsb-manual/trunk/html/). This includes sending (typed) messages from the Browser to the connected systems with [kognijs-rsb](https://github.com/aleneum/kognijs-rsb) and creating custom widgets to alter the state of view models or react to changes with [kognijs-animate](https://github.com/aleneum/kognijs-animate).

This packages provides the means to connect both functionality and also allow to configure system model and view model connections without the need of writing code.
